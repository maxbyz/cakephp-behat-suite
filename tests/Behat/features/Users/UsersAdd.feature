    And I log in

  Scenario:

    Then the response is successful

  Scenario:
    When I post 'users/add' with payload:

      | foo       | foo@foo.foo    | 1234     |

      | foo       | foo@foo.foo    |
    And I am redirected to 'users'
    And the flash message shows 'The user has been saved.'
